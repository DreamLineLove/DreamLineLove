### Goals
- Learn to use Linux, basic and popular Linux utilities (including command-line-only Linux).
- Writing protocols that are often taken for granted from scratch in C (including TCP, HTTP, and makeshift database)
- C programming language and concurrent programming in C
- Starting from simple databases like SQLLite to PostgresSQL
- Low-level programs like Compilers and Kernels in C
- After being exposed to a lot of low-level stuff, learn Rust
- A host of other development tools such as Tmux, Lua configuration with Neovim, Docker, and site-level CI/CD.
- Networking at a high level and hosting a server/website.
- Java programming language, OOP patterns, and if possible, a small web app hosted from start to finish (in Java)
--->

<!--
### Overall Goals
- Learn to use Linux as a server environment as well as your development environment
- Development tools such as Docker, CI/CD, Tmux annd Neovim configuration
- C programming language and its quirks
- Data structures and algorithms in C
- Concurrency and parallelism in C
- Learn how to write operating system and language stuff with C (and understand many low-level details)
- Implement protocols that are taken for granted from scratch in C (including TCP, HTTP, and a makeshift database)
- Implement networking at a high level and host a server/website from start to finish
- Databases from simple to advanced
- Java programming language and Go programming language
- Learn modern web development techniques and implement them in Java or Go
--->

<!--
### Overlook
- Linux, and development tools
- C programming language
- Data structures and algorithms in C
- Concurrency and paralleism in C
- Protocols in C (including networking)
- Compiler class in C
- Operating systems class in C

- High-level networking and deployment from start to finish 
- Databases from simple to advanced
- Learn web development practices 
--->
  
## Upcoming endeavours
<!--
- Regex CLI tool rewritten in Go
- A simple kernel loaded by GRUB on a VM
- Networking from scratch (Go and C/C++)
- Simple web apps in Java and Go (including SQL)
- Deployment (linux on VM and on Docker)
- De-abstractification of concepts usually taken for granted
- ThePrimeagen's data structures and algorithms course in C
- Java programming language, and Object-Oriented paradigm
- Operating systems (kernel) course and compiler lessons
- Database indexing, TCP/IP, HTTP protocol custom implementation 
- Rust and OCaml after high enough low-level sensitivity is gained
- Linux, Bash, and GNU Parallel
- Deployment (learn DNS, networking, VM or Docker, and NGINX)
- Neovim configuration (lua + ecosystem) and tmux
--->
- C programming language (including manual memory management & programs with concurrency/parallelism)
- Data structures and algorithms in C
